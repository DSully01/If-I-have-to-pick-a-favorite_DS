    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Curaçao, with its clear blue waters, stunning sunsets, and warm ocean temperatures, has become our family’s favorite getaway.</p>

        <h2>Experience Highlights</h2>
        <h3>Snorkeling and Sea Life</h3>
        <p>Snorkeling right from our hotel, we saw vibrant fish and coral, much like scenes from <em>Finding Nemo</em>. Each dive was a new adventure!</p>

        <h3>Swimming with Turtles</h3>
        <p>We had a chance to swim with turtles at a nearby beach, an unforgettable experience for everyone.</p>

        <h3>Baseball and Bonding</h3>
        <p>As baseball fans, we loved learning that Curaçao’s national sport is baseball, making it extra special for our son.</p>

        <h3>Exploring Willemstad</h3>
        <p>Walking through Willemstad, we admired the vibrant architecture and even had fun on the swinging bridge when it opened for passing boats!</p>

        <h2>Memories and Emotions</h2>
        <p>The peaceful sound of the ocean while enjoying pizza on the beach brought us a sense of calm. Evenings spent watching the sunset from local restaurants and making new friends from California made it all the more special.</p>
        <p>Looking back at photos of our son snorkeling and of us as a family, I’m filled with cherished memories of time spent together in Curaçao.</p>

    <section id="recommendations">
        <h2>Our Recommendations</h2>
        <p>For anyone planning a trip to Curaçao, we recommend staying at one of the hotels along the south shore, just east of Willemstad. The calm waters are perfect for a relaxing stay, and it’s easy to visit town for sightseeing.</p>
        <p>Make sure to try the turtle snorkeling tour and, if you’re a golfer, the local courses are fantastic!</p>
